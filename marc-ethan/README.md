# 07-nodejs-npm-express

**Author**: Marc and Ethan
**Version**: 1.0.7

## Overview
- This application was initialized with `npm init`, which created package.json and package-lock.json.
- We added node_modules to our .gitignore file
- We used NPM to install ExpressJS and checked that it was saved as a dependency in the package.json file.
- We instantiated the ExpressJS framework and configured the app.use() middleware to interface with the file system to serve static resources. 
- We ensured that the server listens for incoming requests by giving us a message to let us know on which port the server is running.
- We ran the server using node server and ensured that our app functions correctly. 
- We created a route and callback that served up the new.html page via `/new`
- We created a 404 route to handle any bad requests and delivered a 404 message.
