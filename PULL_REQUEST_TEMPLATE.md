#### Single-line Summary
**Today, John and Craig paired together. It took about 2 1/2 hours**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started by looking at our readme file.
  2. Next, we started by setting up the npm init and bringing in the package.js, package-lock.js, expressjs and adding modules to the gitignore 
  3. After that, we started to set up the page using Node.js
  4. After getting the page responding to the server, we got the server to appear on a page. 
  5. After that, we made a 404 responsive page for when someone doesn't look up our page exactly.
